# C220-Final-Project
# Reverse Frog
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
You are a frog who hates the city and wants to reverse time and travel back to before the city was built. We also played on the idea of reverse by having our character travel left, instead of right.

## Game Play
Look for a portal to get to the forest.

Use WASD to move, space to jump. Press f to interact with characters.

## Impediments
We struggled with the colliders, making sure that the player would not fall though the tile map. This was a suprise because we struggled to find the root of the cause, and had never incountered this problem before. We also had trouble with github, with one member unable to gain access at the start.

## Implementation
All art assests used were created by Alyssa and Rylie.
All sound assets used were created or imported by Carolina.
